Description:
The moarTP plugin adds 4 new commands for convenient, customized teleportation. Instead of dealing with coordinates or depending on other players, users may save locations to the server for easy teleportation later. This provides for easy navigation between player creations.

The 4 commands added by this plugin are:
/goto [location] : teleport to a custom location
/claim [location] : define a custom location (where you're standing)
/unclaim [location] : remove a custom location
/view : view all locations in the system

The plugin is still in its early stages, as a number of new features and cleaned-up interfaces will soon be added. These include a better display for /view, the ability to define sub-locations for locations, a /move command for ops to teleport other players, location descriptions, and more.  Visit http://github.com/ofallonminecraft/moarTP for the latest code!


Instructions for use:
Download the plugin from http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/moarTP.  Place in your plugins folder for your Bukkit server, and reload the server.  It should be ready to go!
