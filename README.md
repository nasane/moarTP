# Description:
The moarTP plugin adds 8 new commands for convenient, customized teleportation. Instead of dealing with coordinates or depending on other players, users may save locations to the server for easy teleportation later. This provides for easy navigation between player creations.


The 8 commands added by this plugin are:

    /tpto    [location]                              : teleport to a custom location
    /claim   [location] (["description"])    	     : define a custom location (where you're standing)
    /unclaim [location]                              : remove a custom location
    /view                                            : view all locations in the system
    /about   [location]               	      	     : view location information
    /move [player1(,player2,player3,...)] [location] : teleport other player(s) to a custom location
    /sethome [location]                              : set your personal home location
    /gohome                                          : go to your personal home location


The plugin is still in its early stages, as a number of new features and cleaned-up interfaces will soon be added. These include the ability to define sub-locations for locations, the ability to define secret locations only you can view and teleport to, some sort of map cursors for locations, and more.
